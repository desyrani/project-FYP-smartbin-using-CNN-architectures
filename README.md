**Overview**

This project aims to classify and categorize waste items using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the Smart Bin system. By leveraging several state-of-the-art CNN architectures, the system is designed to efficiently classify waste items in real-time, allowing for better waste management and recycling. The following CNN models are used for the classification task:

- DenseNet121
- EfficientNetB3
- MobileNetV2
- ResNet50V2
- VGG16

Each of these models is evaluated based on its classification performance for identifying waste items.

**How It Works**

In this project, we use several CNN architectures to classify waste items in the Smart Bin system. The models were trained using waste image datasets and then evaluated based on their performance.

The models were selected for their efficiency, accuracy, and ability to perform well on image classification tasks:

- DenseNet121: Known for its compact architecture and high performance.
- EfficientNetB3: A highly efficient model that performs well even with fewer parameters.
- MobileNetV2: Optimized for mobile and edge computing devices, ideal for real-time applications.
- ResNet50V2: A deep architecture that uses residual connections to avoid vanishing gradient problems.
- VGG16: A classical deep CNN model, widely used in image classification tasks.
